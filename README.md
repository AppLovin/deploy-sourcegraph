## Contributing

We understand there is great diversity in Kubernetes environments from company to company, which is
why we've made this Helm chart open source. If there is a configuration point or Kubernetes option
you would like to add, we would love to incorporate it. Pull requests are reviewed and responded to
quickly, and let us know if you have any questions along the way!
